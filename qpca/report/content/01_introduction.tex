%%2nd Paragraph: Narrow the motivation to a technological challenge.
Requirements for e.~g. robust, scale-able, or flexible solutions apply to classical\footnote{In this paper the term \emph{classical} is used to refer to computer systems working with bits that represent exactly one out of two possible states \{0, 1\}.} and quantum based software alike. Hence, they both should be subject to the best practices of software engineering.

%%3rd Paragraph: Briefly list the existing technological solutions
A survey through the landscape and horizons of quantum software engineering has been compiled by J. Zhao \cite{Zhao_2020} and they introduced a quantum software life-cycle from requirements analysis up to maintenance based on the classical waterfall model. They also discussed various topics in quantum computing that have been addressed and solved theoretically by the research community already.

%%4th Paragraph: Point to the gap between the current solutions/knowledge and the technical challenge described in paragraph 2

%%5th Paragraph: My insight
In this paper, I investigate the problem of feature reduction on high dimensional data sets, more specifically, by applying \emph{Principal Component Analysis} (PCA) as an example of a full quantum software life-cycle.

%%6th Paragraph: State the problem and explain it in more detail
\emph{The question} that was researched is up to which degree current tools and techniques proposed by the research community can be directly applied to build a quantum based PCA solution. For example, in \cite[p. 7]{He_2021} or \cite[pp. 4-5]{Daski_2015} the authors stated that transforming a classical data set into a quantum state is not necessarily straightforward. They give a few numerical examples but the (mathematical) computation of the unitary operators $U_{prep}$ to prepare a corresponding quantum state are with respect to already known eigenvalues.

%%7th Paragraph: Detail your approach
\emph{The approach} taken in this paper was to briefly go through the different steps in the quantum software life-cycle and apply them to implement a simple quantum based PCA solution for $2 \times 2$ feature matrices. In a second step this solution was enhanced by exchanging parts of the algorithm to overcome the limitations of $2 \times 2$ feature matrices. The integration step has been encapsulated to keep it independent from the actual PCA algorithm as it will turn out to stay a challenge within this papers project phase to integrate arbitrary ($2 \times 2$) feature matrices.

%%8th Paragraph: Detail your contributions
\emph{The contributions} comprise a set of challenges still have to be taken before the evaluated quantum based solutions can be generalized to comply with various software qualities\footnote{In this paper the terms \emph{software qualities} is preferred but can be used synonymous with \emph{non-functional requirements} or \emph{software structural qualities}.}, especially for developers who are new to the different concepts in quantum mechanics or quantum programming. Taking into account the maturity of engineering communities, like the ones behind \emph{qiskit} or \emph{cirq}, the \emph{implications} of this papers results will be subject to constant (re-)evaluation as well.

To allow \emph{reproduction} the source code and test-data are publicly available to the community. \cite{github_repo}

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In section ~\ref{sec:background} relevant concepts to follow this paper are introduced namely a brief overview on PCA in subsection ~\ref{subsec:pca}, different methods to initialize data into and extract data from quantum states in subsection ~\ref{subsec:integration}, and two concepts to compute eigenvalues with the support of quantum computing ~\ref{subsec:qpca}. In section ~\ref{sec:survey} the different steps to implement two simple quantum based PCA solutions are described by following the phases of a quantum software engineering life-cycle. The results and challenges are discussed in ~\ref{sec:discussion}. Finally, section ~\ref{sec:conclusion} summarizes this papers contributions and future work.
